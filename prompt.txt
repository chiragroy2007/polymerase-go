I want you to generate a fully architected project called Poly WebStudio, built with the following requirements:

1. SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT

Build a modern, professional, minimalistic web application that exposes powerful computational biology tools using the poly Go library.

The tech stack:

Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + React + TailwindCSS

Backend: Serverless API routes written in Go, deployed on Vercel

Bioengine: The github.com/bebop/poly library running in Go

Deployment: Entire project deployable on Vercel with minimal config

The user interacts through the frontend, which calls the Go API endpoints.
All biological operations are performed by poly on the server, not the browser.

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Implement the following API endpoints (all using poly internally):

/api/revcomp (POST)
Input: DNA sequence
Output: reverse complement sequence

/api/codon-optimize (POST)
Input: DNA sequence + target organism
Output: codon-optimized sequence

/api/align (POST)
Input: two DNA/protein sequences
Output: global alignment score + aligned sequences

/api/translate (POST)
Input: DNA sequence
Output: translated protein sequence

/api/primer-design (POST)
Input: DNA sequence
Output: forward + reverse primers

Each API endpoint must:

parse JSON input

run the appropriate poly functions

return JSON output

handle invalid sequences gracefully


3. FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
UI Style

Clean, modern, minimalistic

Neutral colors, no fancy gradients

Google-like simplicity, but professional

Responsive layout, easy on eyes

Light mode default

Consistent spacing and readable typography

No unnecessary animations or fancy effects

UI Sections

Build the following pages:

Home page

Simple overview of tools (cards)

Professional tagline: "High-performance bioinformatics tools powered by poly."

Tool pages

Each tool gets its own page:

Reverse Complement

Codon Optimization

Alignment

Translation

Primer Design

Each page contains:

A clean input panel (textarea or fields)

A “Run Tool” button

Output in a monospace viewer

Validation messages

Loading states

Error handling

All frontend interaction should be very smooth, simple, and structured.
